## 1. Why Operating Systems Matter in Cybersecurity

Every single attack you will ever study, execute in a lab, or defend against happens **inside an operating system**. Malware runs as a process. Privilege escalation exploits the boundary between user mode and kernel mode. Ransomware encrypts files by abusing the file system. Rootkits hook into the kernel. Memory injection attacks manipulate process memory. Shell access means OS access.

If you do not understand how an operating system works from the inside, you are essentially trying to pick a lock without knowing how a lock works. You might get lucky occasionally, but you will never be consistent, and you will never be truly dangerous as a professional.

**For your OT/ICS path specifically:** SCADA systems, PLCs, RTUs, and HMIs all run operating systems — sometimes Windows, sometimes Linux, sometimes proprietary real-time operating systems (RTOS). When you assess the security of a power substation's control system or a hospital's building management system, you are assessing an OS. Understanding the foundations here carries directly into every specialised area you will encounter later.

The security mindset for this module: **The OS is both the defender and the battlefield. Attackers abuse OS mechanisms. Defenders understand the same mechanisms to detect abuse. There is no shortcut around this.**

## 2. What Is an Operating System and How Does It Work

### 2.1 The Core Definition

An operating system is software that acts as an intermediary between hardware and applications. It does three fundamental things:

1. **Abstracts hardware** — Applications do not talk to hardware directly. They talk to the OS, which talks to hardware. This is why the same Python script runs on Intel, AMD, and ARM without modification.

2. **Manages resources** — CPU time, RAM, storage, and I/O devices are shared among many processes. The OS decides who gets what and when.

3. **Enforces isolation and security** — The OS ensures one process cannot read another process's memory, one user cannot access another user's files, and unprivileged code cannot control hardware directly.

### 2.2 Major Operating System Families

| Family | Examples | Primary Use | Security Relevance |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Windows NT** | Windows 10/11, Windows Server | Desktop, enterprise | Most attacked OS in the world; AD environments |
| **Unix/Linux** | Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Kali | Servers, embedded, security tools | Most servers run Linux; all security tools target it |
| **macOS** | macOS Ventura, Sonoma | Apple desktops/laptops | Growing target; shares Unix base with Linux |
| **Android** | Android 13/14 | Mobile | Linux kernel underneath |
| **RTOS** | VxWorks, QNX, FreeRTOS | Industrial, embedded, OT | PLCs, RTUs, medical devices, avionics |
| **Proprietary ICS OS** | Various vendor-specific | SCADA, HMI | Legacy, rarely patched, extremely vulnerable |

> **OT/ICS Note:** The RTOS family is critical for your path. VxWorks runs on Boeing 737 systems, Mars rovers, and countless industrial controllers. QNX powers car infotainment, medical devices, and industrial automation. These systems have their own vulnerability profiles and attack surfaces that differ significantly from Windows or Linux. Understanding general OS concepts here gives you the foundation to approach any OS — including the proprietary ones you will encounter in industrial environments.

### 2.3 The OS Architecture — Big Picture

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This layered architecture is the foundation of every security concept you will study. The line between user applications and the kernel is the most important security boundary in modern computing.

### 2.4 Monolithic vs Microkernel vs Hybrid

Understanding kernel architecture types gives you insight into why different OSes have different attack surfaces:

**Monolithic Kernel (Linux):**
All OS services — file systems, device drivers, network stack — run in kernel space (Ring 0). Fast because there is no context switching between kernel components. But a bug in any driver can crash or compromise the entire system.

```
Linux Kernel Space:
[Scheduler] [Memory Manager] [File Systems] [Network Stack] [Drivers] — all at Ring 0
```

**Microkernel (QNX, Minix):**
Only the bare minimum runs in kernel space. Everything else — drivers, file systems — runs in user space. A bug in a driver does not crash the kernel. Slower due to inter-process communication overhead but much more fault-tolerant.

```
QNX Kernel Space: [IPC] [Scheduler] [Basic Memory] — minimal
User Space:       [Drivers] [File Systems] [Network Stack] — isolated
```

**Hybrid Kernel (Windows NT, macOS XNU):**
A pragmatic blend. Core services in kernel, some services in user space. Windows has a separate subsystem process (csrss.exe) for some Win32 services, but most runs in kernel space for performance.

> **Security Insight:** QNX's microkernel design is why it is used in safety-critical systems — a fault in one component does not take down the entire system. This is directly relevant to OT/ICS: when evaluating industrial systems, the kernel architecture tells you a lot about fault isolation and what happens when one component is compromised.

## 3. The Kernel — The Heart of Everything

### 3.1 What the Kernel Is

The kernel is the core of the operating system. It is the first software that loads after the bootloader and the last software that runs. It is the only software with direct, unrestricted access to hardware.

Everything else — every application, every service, every process — runs in a sandboxed environment and must ask the kernel for resources through a controlled interface called system calls.

The kernel has four primary responsibilities:

**1. Process Management**
Creating, scheduling, pausing, and killing processes. Deciding which process runs on which CPU core at what time.

**2. Memory Management**
Allocating and freeing RAM. Creating virtual address spaces for each process. Enforcing memory isolation between processes.

**3. Device Management**
Communicating with hardware via device drivers. Abstracting hardware differences so applications do not need hardware-specific code.

**4. File System Management**
Organising storage into a consistent interface. Enforcing access permissions on files and directories.

### 3.2 The Kernel as the Ultimate Security Authority

The kernel enforces every software-level security control:

- **File permissions** — The kernel checks if you have read/write/execute permission before allowing file access.
- **Process isolation** — The kernel enforces that Process A cannot read Process B's memory.
- **Privilege enforcement** — The kernel enforces that user-mode code cannot execute privileged CPU instructions.
- **Network filtering** — Firewall rules in the OS (iptables, Windows Firewall) run in the kernel's network stack.

**The consequence:** If an attacker controls the kernel, they control all of these security mechanisms. They can disable file permission checks. They can read any process's memory. They can hide their processes from the process list. They can intercept all network traffic. **A kernel-level compromise is total compromise.**

This is why kernel exploits are so valuable and so dangerous. It is also why rootkits target the kernel — because that is where the security controls live, and controlling the controller means controlling everything.

### 3.3 Kernel Modules and Drivers — The Expansion Surface

The kernel can be extended at runtime through loadable modules (Linux) or drivers (Windows). These modules run in kernel space with full Ring 0 privilege.

**Linux Kernel Modules:**
```bash
# List loaded kernel modules
lsmod

# Load a module
sudo modprobe <module_name>

# Remove a module
sudo rmmod <module_name>
```

**Security Implication:** Loading a malicious kernel module gives an attacker complete, persistent control over the system. This is exactly how kernel rootkits work — they load a malicious module that:
- Hides files from directory listings
- Hides processes from tools like `ps` and Task Manager
- Hides network connections from `netstat`
- Captures keystrokes
- Intercepts and modifies system call results

**Real-world example:** The Azazel rootkit, Reptile rootkit, and numerous APT implants use kernel module techniques on Linux. On Windows, rootkits like TDL4 (Alureon) modified the boot process to load malicious kernel drivers before Windows security initialised.

**Kernel Module Signing:** Modern kernels require modules to be cryptographically signed by a trusted key. On Linux with Secure Boot enabled, unsigned modules are rejected. Attackers bypass this by exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate signed drivers — this is called **BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)**, a technique used by threat groups like Lazarus and BlackByte ransomware operators.

> **Key Security Concept:** BYOVD is currently one of the most important kernel-level attack techniques in the wild. The attacker does not need to write a malicious driver from scratch. They bring a legitimate, signed driver that has a known vulnerability, exploit it to gain kernel-level code execution, and then use that access to disable security software or install a rootkit. Understanding kernel modules is the prerequisite for understanding this class of attack.

## 4. User Mode vs Kernel Mode

### 4.1 The Fundamental Division

This concept is so important it deserves its own section. Modern CPUs implement a hardware-enforced privilege separation between two execution contexts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              KERNEL MODE (Ring 0)               │
│                                                 │
│  • Direct hardware access                       │
│  • All CPU instructions available               │
│  • Full memory access                           │
│  • No restrictions                              │
│                                                 │
│  OS Kernel, Device Drivers, Kernel Modules      │
│                                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  ← Hardware-enforced boundary
│              USER MODE (Ring 3)                 │
│                                                 │
│  • No direct hardware access                    │
│  • Privileged instructions cause exception      │
│  • Only own process memory accessible           │
│  • Must use system calls to request resources   │
│                                                 │
│  Applications, Services, Malware, Your Code     │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Why This Boundary Exists

Without this separation, any program could:
- Overwrite the OS kernel in memory.
- Read passwords from other processes.
- Disable security software by killing its process.
- Directly write to disk, bypassing file system permissions.
- Send arbitrary network packets, bypassing firewalls.

The boundary prevents all of this. A bug in a user-mode application can crash that application. A bug in a kernel-mode component can crash the entire system (Blue Screen of Death on Windows, Kernel Panic on Linux).

### 4.3 How the Transition Works

When a user-mode program needs something that requires kernel-mode access — reading a file, creating a network socket, allocating memory — it makes a **system call**. This is a controlled, intentional crossing of the boundary:

```
User Mode Application
        │
        │  Calls: read(fd, buffer, count)  [C library wrapper]
        │
        ▼
System Library (glibc / ntdll.dll)
        │
        │  Issues: SYSCALL instruction (x86-64 Linux)
        │          or SYSENTER / INT 0x80 (older)
        │          or SYSCALL via ntdll (Windows)
        │
        ▼
CPU switches to Ring 0, kernel takes over
        │
        │  Kernel: validates parameters, checks permissions,
        │          performs the actual operation
        │
        ▼
CPU switches back to Ring 3
        │
        ▼
User Mode Application receives result
```

The system call interface is the only legitimate way to cross from user mode to kernel mode. Every file read, every network connection, every process creation goes through this path.

### 4.4 Security Attacks on This Boundary

The user mode / kernel mode boundary is one of the most attacked boundaries in computing:

**Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):**
A vulnerability in a kernel system call handler that allows user-mode code to execute with kernel privileges or gain root/SYSTEM access. These are among the most valuable vulnerabilities in offensive security.

Examples:
- **CVE-2021-4034 (PwnKit)** — A 12-year-old vulnerability in `pkexec` that allowed any user to escalate to root on virtually every Linux distribution. Trivially exploitable, required no special conditions.
- **CVE-2020-0796 (SMBGhost)** — A kernel vulnerability in Windows 10's SMB driver. Allowed unauthenticated remote code execution at kernel level.
- **DirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847)** — Linux kernel pipe vulnerability allowing any user to overwrite read-only files, including `/etc/passwd`.

**Kernel Address Space Layout Randomisation (KASLR):**
The kernel randomises its own memory layout to make exploitation harder. Many modern exploits first leak a kernel address to defeat KASLR before attempting privilege escalation.

**SMEP and SMAP (from Stage 0.1):**
CPU features that prevent the kernel from executing or accessing user-mode memory. These hardware features are specifically designed to stop kernel exploits that try to jump into user-mode shellcode.

> **Mindset shift:** When you see a vulnerability description that says "allows local privilege escalation" or "EoP (Elevation of Privilege)," you now know exactly what is happening at the architectural level. The vulnerability crosses the user-mode / kernel-mode boundary in an unauthorised way. This understanding is what separates someone who reads exploit descriptions from someone who understands them.

### 4.5 Windows-Specific: Sessions, Integrity Levels, and Protected Processes

Windows adds additional layers on top of the basic user/kernel split:

**Session 0 Isolation:**
Services run in Session 0, user applications run in Session 1+. This separation prevents user applications from interacting with service windows (a vector for privilege escalation called "Shatter Attacks" in older Windows).

**Integrity Levels (Mandatory Integrity Control):**
Windows adds a trust level to every process and object:

| Level | Examples | Can Write To |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Low | Internet Explorer sandboxed, downloads | Temp folders only |
| Medium | Normal user applications | User's profile |
| High | Elevated (UAC) processes | System directories |
| System | Windows services, SYSTEM | Everything |

A Medium integrity process cannot write to a High integrity process's memory. This is why UAC bypasses are important — they allow a Medium integrity process to elevate to High without triggering the UAC prompt.

**Protected Processes Light (PPL):**
Security-critical processes (antivirus engines, LSASS) can run as PPL. Even a process running as SYSTEM cannot open a PPL process with write access. This is why Mimikatz requires a kernel driver to dump credentials from LSASS on modern Windows — it cannot access LSASS from user mode even as SYSTEM.

---

## 5. Processes and Threads

### 5.1 What Is a Process

A process is an instance of a running program. When you double-click `notepad.exe`, Windows creates a process. That process has:

- Its own **virtual address space** — 4 GB on 32-bit, 128 TB on 64-bit
- Its own **set of handles** — open files, network sockets, registry keys
- Its own **security context** — the user account it runs as, its integrity level
- At least one **thread** — the actual execution unit

**Processes are isolated from each other.** Process A cannot read Process B's memory directly. The kernel enforces this through the MMU's page table mechanism.

### 5.2 What Is a Thread

A thread is the actual unit of execution within a process. A process can have one thread or thousands. Threads within the same process share:
- The virtual address space
- Open handles
- The security context

But each thread has its own:
- **Stack** — local variables, function call chain, return addresses
- **Register state** — what the CPU was doing when this thread last ran
- **Thread ID (TID)**

```
Process (notepad.exe)
├── Virtual Address Space (shared)
├── Heap (shared)
├── Open Handles (shared)
│
├── Thread 1 (Main UI thread)
│   ├── Stack
│   └── Registers (RIP, RSP, ...)
│
├── Thread 2 (Background save thread)
│   ├── Stack
│   └── Registers
│
└── Thread 3 (Spell check thread)
    ├── Stack
    └── Registers
```

### 5.3 Process Creation — What Happens Under the Hood

Understanding process creation is critical for malware analysis and process injection attacks.

**On Linux:**
```c
fork()   → Creates a copy of the current process (parent → child)
exec()   → Replaces the current process image with a new program
```

The combination of `fork()` + `exec()` is how every new process is created on Unix-like systems. The shell forks itself, then the child calls `exec()` to become the new program.

**On Windows:**
```
CreateProcess() → All-in-one API to create a new process
```

Windows uses a single API call, but internally it creates a new process object, maps the executable, creates the initial thread, and loads required DLLs.

**Security Relevance — Process Injection:**

Because threads within a process share memory, attackers inject malicious code into legitimate processes to:
- Hide malicious activity under a trusted process name (svchost.exe, explorer.exe)
- Inherit the security context of the target process (impersonation)
- Bypass application whitelisting (code runs inside a whitelisted process)

Common injection techniques you will study later:
- **Classic DLL injection** — Write shellcode to target process memory, create remote thread
- **Process hollowing** — Create suspended process, replace its memory with malicious image
- **Thread hijacking** — Suspend a thread, overwrite its context to redirect execution
- **APC injection** — Queue asynchronous procedure calls to a thread

All of these techniques manipulate the process and thread model described here.

### 5.4 Process Scheduling

The OS scheduler decides which thread runs on which CPU core at what time. Modern schedulers are **preemptive** — the OS can interrupt a running thread at any moment and give CPU time to another thread. This is why your computer can run many programs "simultaneously" on a small number of cores.

**Security Relevance — Race Conditions:**

Scheduling creates **time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU)** vulnerabilities. The OS checks if you have permission to access a file, then accesses it. Between the check and the use, another thread can swap the file for a different one. The check was valid, but the use is on the wrong file.

**CVE-2022-21999 (Windows Print Spooler)** and the famous **Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195)** Linux kernel vulnerability are TOCTOU race conditions. Dirty COW allowed any local user to write to read-only memory mappings by winning a race in the kernel's copy-on-write implementation — gaining root in seconds on virtually every Linux system in existence at the time.

### 5.5 Viewing Processes in Practice

**Windows:**
```powershell
# List all processes with details
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id, CPU, WorkingSet, Path

# Find process by name
Get-Process -Name "notepad"

# Show process tree (parent-child relationships)
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, Name, ExecutablePath

# Sysinternals Process Explorer — industry standard for process investigation
# Download: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Full process list with details
ps aux

# Process tree — shows parent-child relationships
pstree -p

# Real-time process monitor
top
htop  # Better version, install with: sudo apt install htop

# Detailed info for specific process
ls -la /proc/<PID>/
cat /proc/<PID>/status
cat /proc/<PID>/maps    # Memory map
cat /proc/<PID>/cmdline # Command that started this process
ls -la /proc/<PID>/fd/  # Open file descriptors
```

> **Analyst Note:** During malware analysis and incident response, understanding process parent-child relationships is crucial. Legitimate process trees have predictable structures. Malware reveals itself through anomalies — `cmd.exe` spawned by `excel.exe`, `powershell.exe` spawned by `winword.exe`, or any process with a PPID that does not make logical sense. This is a core detection technique used in every SOC and EDR product.

## 6. File System Structures — NTFS, ext4, FAT32

### 6.1 What Is a File System

A file system is the method an OS uses to organise, store, and retrieve data on a storage device. Without a file system, a disk is just raw sectors of binary data. The file system imposes structure — files, directories, permissions, metadata — that makes the data usable.

Understanding file systems is essential for:
- **Digital forensics** — recovering deleted files, analysing timestamps, finding hidden data
- **Privilege escalation** — exploiting misconfigured file permissions
- **Malware analysis** — understanding where malware stores itself and what it modifies
- **Incident response** — understanding what was accessed, modified, or deleted and when

### 6.2 NTFS — Windows File System

**NTFS (New Technology File System)** has been the primary Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1 (1993). It is a journaling file system with rich security features.

#### NTFS Structure

The most important structure in NTFS is the **MFT (Master File Table)**. The MFT is a database where every file and directory on the volume has at least one record. Think of it as the file system's index.

```
MFT Record (1024 bytes per record):
├── Standard Information  → Timestamps (Created, Modified, Accessed, MFT Changed)
├── File Name            → The file's name (can have multiple for short name compatibility)
├── Security Descriptor  → Access Control List (who can read/write/execute)
├── Data Attribute       → The actual file content (or pointer to it if large)
└── Object ID            → Unique identifier for the file
```

#### NTFS Security — Access Control Lists (ACLs)

NTFS implements discretionary access control through ACLs. Every file and directory has a **Security Descriptor** that contains:

- **Owner** — who owns the file
- **DACL (Discretionary Access Control List)** — who can do what
- **SACL (System Access Control List)** — what to audit

```powershell
# View file permissions
Get-Acl C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe | Format-List

# View in icacls format
icacls C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
```

> **Security Relevance:** Misconfigured NTFS permissions are a primary vector for Windows privilege escalation. If a service binary is writable by a non-administrative user, that user can replace it with a malicious executable. When the service starts (often as SYSTEM), the malicious code runs with SYSTEM privileges. Tools like **PowerUp** and **WinPEAS** automate the search for these misconfigurations during post-exploitation.

#### NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

This is one of the most important NTFS features from a security perspective.

NTFS supports multiple data streams per file. Every file has a default, unnamed data stream (`:$DATA`) that contains the file's contents. But a file can have additional named streams that are completely invisible in normal directory listings.

```cmd
# Create an alternate data stream
echo "hidden malicious content" > legitimate_file.txt:hidden_stream

# The file appears normal in directory listing
dir legitimate_file.txt
# Output: legitimate_file.txt  (shows only the main stream's size)

# The hidden content is there
more < legitimate_file.txt:hidden_stream
# Output: hidden malicious content

# Find ADS on a system
dir /r  # /r flag shows alternate data streams
streams.exe -s C:\  # Sysinternals Streams tool
```

**Malware and ADS:**
Attackers use ADS to hide malicious executables and scripts inside legitimate files. The host file appears innocent, but the malicious code lives in a hidden stream.

**Zone.Identifier — The Beneficial ADS:**
Windows uses an ADS called `Zone.Identifier` to mark files downloaded from the internet. When you download a file from a browser, Windows adds this stream:

```
[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
ReferenceUrl=https://example.com/malware.exe
```

This is what causes the "This file was downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to run it?" warning. Malware often deletes this stream (using `Unblock-File` in PowerShell or `attrib`) to suppress the warning. Forensically, the absence of `Zone.Identifier` on a file that should have been downloaded is itself a suspicious indicator.

#### NTFS Timestamps — A Forensic Gold Mine (and Minefield)

NTFS maintains four timestamps per file in the Standard Information attribute:
- **Created ($SI_Created)**
- **Modified ($SI_Modified)**
- **Accessed ($SI_Accessed)**
- **MFT Record Changed ($SI_MFTChanged)**

And four more in the File Name attribute:
- **$FN_Created, $FN_Modified, $FN_Accessed, $FN_MFTChanged**

**Timestomping:**
Attackers routinely modify timestamps to blend malicious files with legitimate ones or to destroy the forensic timeline. PowerShell makes this trivial:

```powershell
# Modify timestamps to evade detection
(Get-Item malware.exe).CreationTime = "01/01/2020 12:00:00"
(Get-Item malware.exe).LastWriteTime = "01/01/2020 12:00:00"
```

**The forensic catch:**
Timestomping only modifies the `$Standard_Information` timestamps — the ones visible to normal tools. The `$File_Name` timestamps are updated by the kernel itself and are much harder to modify from user mode. Forensic tools like **Autopsy** and **MFTECmd** compare both sets of timestamps. A discrepancy between `$SI` and `$FN` timestamps is a strong indicator of timestomping.

### 6.3 ext4 — Linux File System

**ext4 (Fourth Extended File System)** is the default file system for most Linux distributions. It is a journaling file system descended from ext2 and ext3.

#### ext4 Structure

```

**The Inode:**
The inode is ext4's equivalent of NTFS's MFT record. Every file and directory has an inode that stores:

```
Inode Contents:
├── File type (regular file, directory, symlink, device...)
├── Permissions (rwxrwxrwx)
├── Owner (UID) and Group (GID)
├── Timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime, crtime on ext4)
├── File size
├── Hard link count
├── Pointers to data blocks
└── Extended attributes
```

**Critical point:** The inode does NOT store the filename. Filenames are stored in directory entries that point to inodes. This separation is fundamental to Linux forensics.

```bash
# View inode information
stat /etc/passwd

# Find a file's inode number
ls -i /etc/passwd

# Find all files with a specific inode (hard links)
find / -inum <inode_number> 2>/dev/null
```

#### Linux File Permissions — The Security Model

Linux uses a simple but powerful permission model based on three categories and three permission bits:

```
-rwxr-xr--  1  root  wheel  4096  Jan 1 00:00  file.sh
 │││││││││
 ││││││││└── Others: r-- (read only)
 │││││││└─── Others execute: no
 ││││││└──── Others write: no
 │││││└───── Group: r-x (read + execute)
 ││││└────── Group execute: yes
 │││└─────── Group write: no
 ││└──────── Owner: rwx (read + write + execute)
 │└───────── Owner execute: yes
 └────────── File type: - (regular file)
```

**Octal representation:**
```
r = 4, w = 2, x = 1

rwxr-xr-- = 754
rwxrwxrwx = 777 (dangerous — world writable and executable)
rw-r--r-- = 644 (typical for config files)
rwx------ = 700 (owner only, good for private scripts)
```

**SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit — The Dangerous Permissions:**

These are special permission bits that are frequently misconfigured and exploited for privilege escalation.

**SUID (Set User ID — bit 4000):**
When set on an executable, it runs with the privileges of the file's **owner**, not the user executing it. If root owns a SUID binary, it runs as root for anyone who executes it.

```bash
# Find all SUID files on the system
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

# Example: /usr/bin/passwd is SUID root
# A normal user can change their own password because
# passwd needs to write to /etc/shadow (root-only file)
ls -la /usr/bin/passwd
# Output: -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/passwd
#              ^-- 's' means SUID is set
```

**Exploiting SUID for privilege escalation:**
If a SUID binary has a vulnerability or is misconfigured (e.g., a SUID shell), it can be exploited to gain root:

```bash
# If bash is somehow SUID (misconfiguration):
ls -la /bin/bash
# -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /bin/bash
bash -p  # -p preserves effective UID → instant root shell
```

GTFOBins (gtfobins.github.io) is an invaluable reference listing SUID binary exploitation techniques for dozens of standard utilities.

**SGID (Set Group ID — bit 2000):**
Similar to SUID but sets the effective group ID. On directories, new files inherit the directory's group — useful for shared directories, exploitable if misconfigured.

**Sticky Bit (bit 1000):**
On directories, prevents users from deleting files they do not own. `/tmp` uses this so all users can write to it but cannot delete each other's files.

```bash
ls -la /tmp
# drwxrwxrwt  ...  /tmp
#          ^-- 't' means sticky bit is set
```

#### /proc — The Virtual File System That Exposes Everything

`/proc` is a pseudo-filesystem in Linux that provides a window into the kernel's view of the system. Nothing in `/proc` is actually on disk — it is generated dynamically by the kernel.

```bash
# Every running process has a directory in /proc
ls /proc/
# Output includes: 1  2  3  ...  <PID of every process>  ...  cpuinfo  meminfo

# Investigate a specific process
cat /proc/<PID>/cmdline     # Command line arguments
cat /proc/<PID>/status      # Detailed process status
cat /proc/<PID>/maps        # Memory map (address ranges, permissions)
cat /proc/<PID>/net/tcp     # Network connections of this process
ls -la /proc/<PID>/fd/      # Open file descriptors
cat /proc/<PID>/environ     # Environment variables (may contain secrets!)
```

> **Security Insight:** `/proc/<PID>/environ` can contain environment variables including API keys, passwords, and tokens passed to processes at startup. This is a common source of credential exposure in poorly configured applications. During privilege escalation, examining the environment of high-privilege processes you can read can yield credentials.

### 6.4 FAT32 — The Legacy Standard

**FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32)** is a simple, old file system designed in the MS-DOS era. It lacks security features but is universally compatible:

- No user permissions or ownership
- No journaling (data loss risk on improper unmount)
- Maximum file size: **4 GB** (a critical limitation)
- Maximum volume size: **2 TB**
- No alternate data streams

**When you encounter FAT32 in security contexts:**

1. **USB drives and embedded systems** — Most USB drives and SD cards are FAT32 for compatibility. Many embedded devices, PLCs, and industrial HMIs use FAT32 for removable media. FAT32 has no access control — anyone with physical access to the media can read everything.

2. **UEFI EFI System Partition** — The partition that UEFI reads bootloaders from is FAT32. This is why UEFI firmware can read bootloaders before any OS is loaded — UEFI has a built-in FAT32 driver.

3. **Forensic recovery** — FAT32's simple structure makes file recovery relatively straightforward with tools like Foremost and PhotoRec.

4. **OT Devices** — Many legacy industrial devices store configuration files and firmware on FAT32 formatted flash cards. These can be removed, copied, modified, and reinserted — a significant physical security concern in OT environments.

## 7. Memory Management

### 7.1 Virtual Memory — The Foundation of Process Isolation

We introduced virtual memory in Stage 0.1. Here we go deeper into the mechanisms and their security implications.

Every process operates in its own **virtual address space**. The process believes it has a large, contiguous block of memory entirely to itself. In reality, this virtual space is backed by:
- Physical RAM (for actively used pages)
- The page file/swap space on disk (for infrequently used pages)
- Memory-mapped files (the executable and its libraries)

The **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** in the CPU performs the translation from virtual to physical addresses using **page tables** maintained by the kernel.

```
Process Virtual Address → [MMU + Page Tables] → Physical RAM Address
                                                         OR
                                               Page File on Disk (page fault → load)
```

### 7.2 Pages, Page Faults, and Swapping

Memory is managed in fixed-size units called **pages** (typically 4 KB, sometimes 2 MB or 1 GB for huge pages).

When a process accesses a virtual address:
1. The MMU checks the page table entry for that address.
2. If the page is in RAM (**present bit set**) → immediate access, fast.
3. If the page is **not in RAM** → **page fault** exception.
4. The kernel handles the page fault: loads the page from disk into RAM, updates the page table.
5. The instruction is retried — this time it succeeds.

**Security Relevance — The Page File:**
The Windows page file (`pagefile.sys`) and Linux swap partition contain pages that were evicted from RAM. This can include:
- Decrypted content from applications that encrypt data at rest
- Passwords from memory
- Encryption keys
- Browser history and cached content

In forensic investigations, the page file is a valuable source of evidence that many investigators overlook. Volatile memory forensics tools like **Volatility** can process page file content alongside RAM dumps.

### 7.3 Memory Permissions and the NX/XD Bit

Each page in virtual memory has associated **permission bits** that control what operations are allowed:

| Permission | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Read (R)** | Process can read data from this page |
| **Write (W)** | Process can write data to this page |
| **Execute (X)** | CPU can execute instructions on this page |

The **NX (No-Execute)** bit on AMD processors and **XD (Execute Disable)** bit on Intel processors allow the OS to mark pages as non-executable. Pages containing data should never be executable. This is the basis of **DEP (Data Execution Prevention)** on Windows and **NX protection** on Linux.

**Before NX/DEP:**
```
Stack Buffer Overflow Attack:
1. Overflow buffer on stack
2. Overwrite return address to point to attacker's shellcode on the stack
3. CPU executes shellcode directly from the stack
→ Game over
```

**After NX/DEP:**
```
Stack Buffer Overflow Attack attempt:
1. Overflow buffer on stack
2. Overwrite return address to point to attacker's shellcode on the stack
3. CPU tries to execute stack page
4. NX bit: this page is marked non-executable → CPU raises exception
→ Program crashes, attack fails
```

**The attacker's response — Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):**
Since code injection is blocked, attackers stopped injecting new code. Instead, they chain together small snippets of existing executable code called **gadgets** — sequences of 2-5 instructions ending in a `ret` instruction. By overwriting the stack with addresses of these gadgets, attackers can build Turing-complete computation entirely from existing, legitimate executable code.

```
Stack after overflow (ROP chain):
[Address of gadget 1]  → executes instructions, then ret
[Address of gadget 2]  → executes instructions, then ret
[Address of gadget 3]  → executes instructions, then ret
[Address of syscall]   → executes execve("/bin/sh") → shell
```

This is one of the most important concepts in modern exploitation. You will study it in depth during Stage 4 and beyond, but understanding page permissions and NX is the foundation.

### 7.4 ASLR — Address Space Layout Randomisation

**ASLR** randomises the base addresses of the stack, heap, and shared libraries in virtual memory on each execution. Without ASLR, the attacker knows exactly where the stack is and where system libraries like `libc` are loaded. ROP chains and other attacks require knowing the addresses of gadgets, which means they need to know where libraries are loaded.

```
Without ASLR (same every run):
  Stack:   0x7fff0000
  libc:    0xb7e00000
  Heap:    0x08048000

With ASLR (different every run):
  Stack:   0x7f4a2000  ← different
  libc:    0xb6c14000  ← different
  Heap:    0x55a3f000  ← different
```

**ASLR Bypasses:**
- **Information leaks** — Vulnerabilities that disclose a memory address allow the attacker to calculate the base address of libraries, defeating ASLR.
- **Brute force** — On 32-bit systems, the address space is small enough that brute force is feasible. On 64-bit systems, the space is too large.
- **Heap spraying** — Fill large portions of memory with shellcode so that a random jump lands in it.

**KASLR (Kernel ASLR):**
Applies the same randomisation to the kernel's own memory layout. Many modern kernel exploits begin with an information leak to defeat KASLR before attempting privilege escalation.

### 7.5 Heap Memory and Heap Vulnerabilities

The **heap** is the region of memory used for dynamic allocation — when your program calls `malloc()` in C or `new` in C++.

The heap is managed by the allocator (part of the C runtime library). The allocator maintains internal metadata (headers and footers on each allocation) that tracks the size and status of each chunk.

**Heap vulnerabilities are some of the most complex and impactful in security:**

**Use-After-Free (UAF):**
A pointer to freed memory is used after the memory has been returned to the allocator. If the attacker can control what gets allocated in that freed region, they can control what the dangling pointer accesses.

```c
char *buf = malloc(256);
free(buf);
// buf is now a dangling pointer
// Attacker allocates something else that occupies the same region
// buf still points to that region
strcpy(buf, attacker_data);  // Writing to attacker-controlled memory
```

UAF vulnerabilities have been responsible for some of the most critical browser exploits. The Chrome V8 engine, Firefox's SpiderMonkey, and Internet Explorer have all had critical UAF vulnerabilities used in real-world attacks.

**Heap Overflow:**
Writing beyond the allocated buffer into adjacent heap chunks, overwriting allocator metadata or other allocations.

## 8. System Calls

### 8.1 What Is a System Call

A system call (syscall) is the mechanism by which user-mode programs request services from the kernel. It is the only legitimate crossing point between user mode and kernel mode.

**Every meaningful action your program takes is ultimately a system call:**

| User Action | System Call (Linux) | System Call (Windows) |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Open a file | `open()` | `NtOpenFile()` |
| Read from file | `read()` | `NtReadFile()` |
| Create process | `fork()` / `execve()` | `NtCreateProcess()` |
| Allocate memory | `mmap()` / `brk()` | `NtAllocateVirtualMemory()` |
| Send network data | `sendto()` | `NtDeviceIoControlFile()` |
| Create a thread | `clone()` | `NtCreateThread()` |

### 8.2 How System Calls Work at the Machine Level

On x86-64 Linux:

```
User Mode Code:
  mov rax, 0         ; System call number 0 = read()
  mov rdi, fd        ; Argument 1: file descriptor
  mov rsi, buffer    ; Argument 2: buffer address
  mov rdx, count     ; Argument 3: byte count
  syscall            ; Trigger the system call

[CPU switches to Ring 0 — kernel mode]

Kernel:
  ; Looks up syscall number 0 in sys_call_table
  ; Validates arguments
  ; Performs the actual read operation
  ; Places return value in rax
  ; Returns to user mode via sysret
```

**Linux system call table:**
```bash
# View system call numbers
cat /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h | grep "#define __NR_"
```

### 8.3 System Calls and Security Monitoring

**This is one of the most important topics for detection engineering and malware analysis.**

Every malicious action that malware performs must ultimately go through system calls. Malware cannot:
- Create a file without calling `open()`/`NtCreateFile()`
- Start a process without calling `fork()`/`CreateProcess()`
- Connect to a network without calling `connect()`/`NtConnect()`
- Inject into another process without calling `VirtualAllocEx()`/`WriteProcessMemory()`

Security tools exploit this inescapability:

**Linux — strace:**
```bash
# Trace all system calls made by a program
strace /bin/ls

# Trace a running process
strace -p <PID>

# Filter for specific syscalls
strace -e trace=open,read,write,connect /bin/ls
```

**Windows — API Monitor / ETW (Event Tracing for Windows):**
Windows EDR products use ETW to monitor Windows API calls. When `cmd.exe` spawns from `winword.exe`, or `powershell.exe` makes a network connection, or `lsass.exe` is accessed with `PROCESS_VM_READ` rights — all of these generate ETW events that security tools consume.

**Seccomp (Linux Sandboxing):**
Modern browsers and containerised applications use **seccomp** (Secure Computing Mode) to restrict which system calls a process is allowed to make. A browser renderer process probably does not need to call `fork()` or `mount()`. Restricting it to only the syscalls it needs dramatically reduces the attack surface.

```c
// Example: allow only read, write, exit, sigreturn
scmp_filter_ctx ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);
seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(read), 0);
seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(write), 0);
seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(exit), 0);
seccomp_load(ctx);
// Any other syscall now kills the process
```

Docker containers use seccomp profiles to restrict container system calls. Understanding seccomp is important for container security (Stage 8).

### 8.4 Syscall-Based Evasion — Direct Syscalls

Modern EDR products hook Windows API functions (in ntdll.dll) to monitor behaviour. When malware calls `VirtualAllocEx()`, the EDR's hook intercepts it, logs it, and decides whether to allow it.

**Attacker response — Direct Syscalls:**
Instead of calling the API function that EDR is monitoring, the malware issues the syscall instruction directly, bypassing the hook entirely:

```asm
; Normal path (EDR can monitor this):
call VirtualAllocEx  → ntdll.dll → [EDR HOOK HERE] → kernel

; Direct syscall (EDR cannot monitor this):
mov r10, rcx
mov eax, 0x18  ; syscall number for NtAllocateVirtualMemory
syscall        → kernel directly, no hooks in the path
```

Tools like **SysWhispers** and **Hells Gate** implement direct syscall techniques and are widely used in offensive tooling including commercial C2 frameworks.

> **The arms race:** EDR vendors responded to direct syscalls by moving their hooks into the kernel itself (kernel callbacks). Attackers responded with BYOVD (bringing vulnerable kernel drivers). This escalation is ongoing and understanding syscalls is the foundation for following it.

## 9. Key Takeaways and Security Mindset

### 9.1 The OS Is Both Fortress and Battlefield

The operating system is simultaneously:
- **The primary security enforcer** — permissions, isolation, privilege levels
- **The primary target** — every attacker tries to subvert OS mechanisms
- **The primary evidence source** — every attack leaves traces in OS structures

Understanding the OS deeply means you understand both how defences work and how they fail. You cannot be effective on either side without this foundation.

### 9.2 The Hierarchy of Trust

```
Hardware (Stage 0.1)
    ↓ enforces
Kernel (this module)
    ↓ enforces
User Mode Applications
    ↓ enforces
File System Permissions, Process Isolation, etc.
```

Every security control at a higher level can be subverted by a compromise at a lower level. OS security controls are meaningless if the kernel is compromised. This hierarchical thinking applies to every system you will assess in your career.

### 9.3 For OT/ICS Environments

The principles in this module apply to every OS — including the ones running on PLCs, HMIs, and SCADA servers. Key specific points:

- **RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems)** often have minimal or no user/kernel separation — everything runs at maximum privilege. This means a vulnerability anywhere in the system potentially means full compromise.
- **Legacy Windows versions** (Windows XP, Windows 7) are common in OT environments. These lack many of the modern security features described in this module — no ASLR, no modern heap protections, outdated system call interfaces.
- **File system permissions** on HMI configuration files, ladder logic backups, and historian databases are frequently misconfigured in OT environments.
- **Process monitoring** is rarely implemented in OT environments — there is often no EDR, no strace-equivalent, no API monitoring. Attacks can run undetected indefinitely.

### 9.4 Core Concepts to Commit to Memory

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| Kernel = absolute authority | Kernel compromise = total compromise |
| User/Kernel mode boundary | Foundation of all privilege escalation |
| Process = isolated unit | Injection = breaking this isolation |
| File permissions | Primary Linux privilege escalation vector |
| NTFS ADS | Hiding malware, Zone.Identifier forensics |
| NTFS timestamps | Forensic timeline, timestomping detection |
| ASLR + NX/DEP | Why modern exploitation requires bypasses |
| System calls = observable | Foundation of EDR detection and evasion |

## 10. Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Process Archaeology (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand what a "normal" process tree looks like so you can spot anomalies.

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Install Sysinternals Process Explorer and Process Monitor
# Download: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/

# Document the parent-child relationships of these processes:
# - explorer.exe → what does it spawn?
# - svchost.exe → how many instances? what services do they host?
# - lsass.exe → what accesses it?

# Using built-in tools:
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | 
    Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, Name, ExecutablePath |
    Sort-Object ParentProcessId |
    Format-Table -AutoSize
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install and use pstree
sudo apt install psmisc
pstree -p -u  # Show PIDs and users

# Document:
# - What spawns init/systemd's children?
# - What processes does your shell spawn when you run a command?
# - What processes does sshd spawn when you connect?

# Compare process lists from /proc vs ps
ls /proc | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' | sort -n > proc_pids.txt
ps aux | awk '{print $2}' | tail -n +2 | sort -n > ps_pids.txt
diff proc_pids.txt ps_pids.txt  
# In a rootkit scenario, a hidden process appears in /proc but not in ps
```

**Goal:** Build the mental model of "normal" — every detection in your career depends on knowing what normal looks like.

### Exercise 2: System Call Tracing (30 minutes)

**Linux:**
```bash
# Trace what happens when you read a file
strace cat /etc/hostname 2>&1 | head -50

# Answer these questions from the strace output:
# 1. What syscall opens the file?
# 2. What syscall reads the content?
# 3. What syscall writes to your terminal?
# 4. What syscall closes the file?

# Trace a network connection
strace -e trace=network curl https://example.com 2>&1 | head -30

# Answer:
# 1. What syscall creates the socket?
# 2. What syscall makes the connection?
# 3. What syscall sends data?
```

**Windows:**
```
Download API Monitor (free): http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor
1. Start monitoring notepad.exe
2. Open a file in Notepad
3. Find NtCreateFile, NtReadFile in the API call log
4. Examine the parameters passed to each call
```

**Goal:** See system calls in action. This directly prepares you for malware analysis — you will trace malware's API calls to understand its behaviour.

### Exercise 3: File System Permissions Audit (30 minutes)

**Linux:**
```bash
# Find all SUID binaries
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

# For each one, look it up on GTFOBins:
# https://gtfobins.github.io/
# Can any of them be exploited?

# Find world-writable files and directories
find / -perm -0002 -not -path "/proc/*" -not -path "/sys/*" 2>/dev/null

# Find files owned by root that are writable by others
find / -user root -perm -0022 -not -path "/proc/*" 2>/dev/null

# Check /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow permissions
ls -la /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
stat /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Find writable directories in PATH (potential DLL hijacking)
$env:PATH -split ';' | ForEach-Object {
    $path = $_
    try {
        $acl = Get-Acl $path -ErrorAction Stop
        $acl.Access | Where-Object {
            $_.IdentityReference -match "Everyone|BUILTIN\\Users|CREATOR OWNER" -and
            $_.FileSystemRights -match "Write|Modify|FullControl"
        } | ForEach-Object {
            "$path - $($_.IdentityReference) - $($_.FileSystemRights)"
        }
    } catch {}
}

# Check service binary permissions
Get-WmiObject Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.PathName} | ForEach-Object {
    $path = $_.PathName -replace '"','' -split ' ' | Select-Object -First 1
    if (Test-Path $path) {
        $acl = Get-Acl $path
        $acl.Access | Where-Object {
            $_.IdentityReference -match "Everyone|BUILTIN\\Users" -and
            $_.FileSystemRights -match "Write|Modify|FullControl"
        } | ForEach-Object {
            "SERVICE: $($_.name) - PATH: $path - $($_.IdentityReference)"
        }
    }
}
```

**Goal:** Perform your first real privilege escalation reconnaissance. These are the exact checks that tools like LinPEAS and WinPEAS automate.

### Exercise 4: NTFS Alternate Data Streams (20 minutes)

```cmd
# Create a test directory
mkdir C:\ADS_Test
cd C:\ADS_Test

# Create a file with hidden content in an ADS
echo "This is visible content" > testfile.txt
echo "This is HIDDEN in ADS" > testfile.txt:secret

# Check the visible content (normal)
type testfile.txt

# The ADS is not visible in dir
dir testfile.txt

# But it exists and can be accessed
more < testfile.txt:secret

# See it with /r flag
dir /r testfile.txt

# Create an executable in an ADS (this is how malware hides payloads)
type C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe > testfile.txt:hidden_exe

# Run it from the ADS
wmic process call create "C:\ADS_Test\testfile.txt:hidden_exe"

# Now find and remove it
streams.exe -d testfile.txt  # Sysinternals streams tool
```

**Goal:** Understand ADS practically. You will encounter this in CTFs, malware analysis, and real-world forensic cases.

### Exercise 5: Memory Layout Exploration (30 minutes)

```bash
# Linux — Examine your own shell's memory layout
cat /proc/$$/maps

# Identify and label each region:
# - The stack (look for [stack])
# - The heap (look for [heap])  
# - The executable itself
# - Shared libraries (libc, etc.)
# - VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object)

# Run the same program twice and compare the addresses (ASLR in action)
cat /proc/$$/maps | grep libc | head -1
# Open another terminal
cat /proc/$$/maps | grep libc | head -1
# The addresses should be different each time

# Check if ASLR is enabled
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# 2 = fully randomised (default)
# 0 = disabled (useful for debugging exploits in a lab)

# Temporarily disable ASLR for exploit development (lab only, never production)
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# Run the address check again — now addresses are consistent
# Re-enable immediately after:
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

**Goal:** Make ASLR tangible. When you later study buffer overflows and ROP chains, you will understand exactly why ASLR exists and why bypassing it is a prerequisite for reliable exploitation.

## Module Summary

| Topic | Core Security Application |
|-------|--------------------------|
| OS Architecture | Understanding the layers attackers target |
| Kernel | Kernel compromise = total compromise; rootkits operate here |
| User/Kernel Mode | Privilege escalation crosses this boundary |
| Processes | Malware hides in processes; injection attacks abuse process model |
| Threads | Race conditions (TOCTOU, Dirty COW) exploit scheduling |
| NTFS | ADS for hiding malware; timestamps for forensics; permissions for privesc |
| ext4 | SUID/SGID for privilege escalation; /proc for process intelligence |
| FAT32 | OT device configuration exposure; UEFI boot partition |
| Memory Management | NX/DEP → ROP; ASLR → info leaks; page file → forensic evidence |
| System Calls | Observable boundary for EDR; direct syscalls for evasion |
